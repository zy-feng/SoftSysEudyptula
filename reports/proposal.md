# Spring 2018 Software Systems Project 2

# Eudyptula
## By Zhengyang Feng and Sungwoo Park

### Project objective and learning goals
The goal of this project is to complete as many Eudyptula challenges as we can. Eudyptula is a series of programming exercises for the linux kernel. It starts from simple “hello world” program to getting a patch accepted for the linux kernel. Also, we would like to get familiar with most up-to-date Linux kernel code through working on those challenges.

We believe that is a reasonable lower bound goal for the project to complete up to task 10, out of 20 total. Task 10 is a milestone of this challenge, as one will become authorized as Linux kernel contributor after task 10.

### Resources
- [http://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/](The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide)
- [https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula](A list of Eudyptula tasks)


### Next steps
1. Look for a resources related to the first task we will be working on
2. Start implementing the first task to get familiar with kernel level programming
3. Improve the code quality through refactoring and referring to the linux kernel documentation for the accepted code quality.
4. Repeat process 1 and 3 for the next 19 tasks.
