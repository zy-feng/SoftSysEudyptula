# Spring 2018 Software Systems Project 2

# Eudyptula
## By Zhengyang Feng and Sungwoo Park

### Project objective
The goal of this project is to complete as many Eudyptula challenges as we can during the timeframe given for this project. Eudyptula is a series of programming exercises for the linux kernel. It gradually gets more complex and difficult, starting from simple “hello world” program to getting a patch accepted by the linux community for the kernel codebase.

We believe that the reasonable lower bound for the project given approximately 1 month time frame is to complete first 10 tasks. However, it should be noted that one of the team members has already completely first few tasks before the official start of the project. Our plan is to independently work on the tasks but work together when it makes sense (cooperate when stuck with a problem, discuss the different implementation strategy, etc).

### Learning goals

By working on this project, we hope to achieve following learning goals:

- Gain more in-depth understanding of how operating systems work in programming level
- Familiarize ourselves with Linux kernel code
- Get more experience in writing professional-level code in terms of code quality and style (A component of each challenge is code quality and style)
- Gain experience in learning and researching about very complex and difficult topic that we do not know very well as of now.

### Resources
- The challenge problems can be found in the link here <https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula>.

- The official kernel module programming guide can be found here <https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/lkmpg.pdf>. The document touches on

- - How to write and run kernel modules
  - How to format the modules professionally
  - How to link the modules to system calls, memory and processes
  - How to manage multiple modules


### Current progress and future plans

We generally follow these steps when working on the tasks:

1. Identify possible resources and materials that will be useful in working on a task
2. Individually work on the task, implementing and coding the requirements specified in the task.
3. Discuss and compare the works.
4. Possibly go back to the code and improve the code quality with the feedback and discussion in mind.

We have completed 9 tasks so far, but we haven’t organized the work and put it on github. Because we have the chance to mess up with the kernel frequently, the related files and final deliveries (mostly as README files) are all over the mirrors across different platforms anywhere. For the final stretch of our project, we will work on organizing our deliverables in a presentable manner.
